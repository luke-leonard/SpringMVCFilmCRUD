### Concepts

* Welcome users and offer the ability to provide a film matching a film id. name, food type and rating for up to 5 food trucks. The user may input quit instead of proving any further names. A numeric id is given to each truck automatically. The program will exit the input truck fields and provide a menu option.


* The program will continuously run a three option menu until the quit option is chosen.

	* First will print out an individual film matching ids entered by the user. Fields contained within films title, year, rating, language, actor list and description.
	* Second option will print out a list of films based on the search criteria entered by the user. Fields contained within films title, year, rating, language, actor list and description.
	* Third option exits the menu and quits the program entirely.
